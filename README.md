## About
Oh no, Team Rocket has stolen the townspeople's Pokemon and is getting away! But lucky for us, we can count on our hero, the dependable Jigglypuff, to save the day.

## How to Play
* Press SPACE to jump and avoid Team Rocket's Pokemon!
* Tapping SPACE twice will result in a double-jump.
* Pick up items to collect bonus points.
* Get the highest score you can!

## Technologies
* Vanilla JavaScript was used for the game logic, with classes for the player, background, score, enemies & items
* HTML5 Canvas for rendering sprites and images

## Future Plans
* More enemies/obstacles added
* New items to pick up (ex. invincibility item)
